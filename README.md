# CMPM 163 Homework 3
This assignment showcases two particle systems reacting to audio in different ways. <b>Used WASD to move in any direction, Space to float directly up, C to sink directly down and Escape to quit the program.</b>
## Part A : Abstract scene using particles and noise
In this part there are two different sets of particle systems using a mixture shaders and scripts to react to music. There are 6 total bubble particle systems. When the  average frequency of the music passes a certain threshold a random bubble system will spawn one bubble. The fish particle systems take the lower quartile, median, and upper quartile of the frequency as input. In the shader a color mask is created and the inputs from the quartiles are applied to the color mask to change only certain parts of the fish. Noise is added to the fish particles to make their movement more erratic and perhaps more like a swimming fish than a static particle.
